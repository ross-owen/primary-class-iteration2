# Overview

This project will help me broaden my knowledge of other IDEs, languages, and data communication types.

This is a Church of Jesus-Christ of Latter-day Saints primary class helper application. It will track students prayers and articles of faith learning/completion. It will also be able to be data-synced with other android devices using NFC taps.

As a primary teacher with a desire to be fair and equal and to my primary students, I want to track prayers and Articles of Faith completion. I also want to be able to keep in sync with my team teacher as well as multiple devices. This will allow period absenses with either of us and be able to always have the latest data shared between devices
